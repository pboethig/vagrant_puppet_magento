vagrant

          READ ME FOR SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION!
          =======================================

If Puppet did not blow up (you do not see a sea of red
above), then your VM was generated successfully!

* A unique private key was generated for you! It is located
  at "puphpet/files/dot/ssh/id_rsa". If you are on Windows,
  a PuTTY-friendly key was also generated at same location
  with a ".ppk" extension.

* If you want to use your own private key for future
  provisions, overwrite the generated key above with your
  own. Make sure to follow the naming pattern, and include a
  ".pub" public key.

* If you wish to add packages, modules, Apache/Nginx vhosts,
  or anything else, open up "puphpet/config.yaml" and make
  changes within! Some things will have random strings like
  "DIdXRs2OI2LJ" - you must create a random string as well!
  To do so, please apply face to keyboard and roll.

* If you change "puphpet/config.yaml", simply run
  "$ vagrant provision" and your VM will be updated with the
  changes you requested!

Did something go wrong? Don't worry! I can (maybe) help!
